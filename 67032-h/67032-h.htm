<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>SERMON.</h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Rom. xiv</span>. 8.</p>
<p><i>For whether we live</i>, <i>we live unto the Lord</i>;
<i>and whether we die</i>, <i>we die unto the Lord</i>:
<i>whether we live therefore</i>, <i>or die</i>, <i>we are the
Lord&rsquo;s</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> text refers to the foregoing
verse: &ldquo;None of us liveth unto himself; and no man dieth to
himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; We are very apt to feel and act, as if we
were independent creatures.&nbsp; Perhaps if examined, as to our
particular creed, we should readily confess ourselves to be
placed under the sovereignty of the Almighty; and to be
accountable, as Christians, at the bar of Him, who will
&ldquo;judge both quick and dead.&rdquo;&nbsp; But few are daily
conscious, as they ought to be, either of their dependence or
their responsibility.&nbsp; Their creed is not in their heart;
they live chiefly and practically under a system of
self-government; grievously forgetting the dominion of the Lord
who created and redeemed them.&nbsp; A proud spirit is, as it has
been from the beginning, the bane of man: he fell through
impatience of his Maker&rsquo;s mild yoke, and an intolerance of
his Maker&rsquo;s superiority: and the poison, thus whispered
into his ear by the evil one, still lurks within him; corrupting
his feeling and principle, and rendering him greatly insensible
to the divine superintendence and blessing.</p>
<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>This
pride and selfishness however the gospel is designed to humble
and correct; and it does produce the mighty change in the heart
of every sincere believer; of all who feel its vital power,
&ldquo;the power of God unto salvation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of all such
it must be said, in the utmost latitude, in the most unqualified
sense, &ldquo;none of us liveth unto himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; There
is no true disciple of the Lord Jesus, who makes earthly
interest, gain or pleasure, ambition or lust, his ruling and
absorbing object.&nbsp; Such is the character of the degenerate
and lost world: there is no fitter description of a worldly man
than this, that he lives to gratify his own humour, and carry out
the schemes of his own wilfulness, and promote his own prosperity
during his little career: earth is his sphere of action, and all
centres in self.&nbsp; But every follower of Christ is called out
of the world, effectually called and chosen and delivered: he has
another mind, another spirit, another view.&nbsp; He cannot live
for himself: it is not merely against his conviction, his sense
of propriety, his professed and deliberate principle, it is
against his new nature: he is born of God, with new affections,
new desires, new purposes, new prospects; the Spirit of the
living God dwells within him; cleanses him from all fleshly
corruption; and brings his will, brings all that he is, and all
that he has, into subjection to the Godhead.&nbsp; This is the
character, the certain and essential and distinguishing character
of all who belong to Christ: they live not, in any regard or in
any matter, for themselves.</p>
<p>Nor do they die unto themselves.&nbsp; They die not, <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>either like the
beasts that perish, or for their own disposal and glory; not to
make bodily or earthly provisions; not to give orders for their
funeral; not to hand down their name and style to posterity upon
a blazoned escutcheon; not to bequeath their riches to others:
&ldquo;after all these things do the Gentiles seek.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But a grand and glorious change has been made by the gospel: the
true nature of death stands now unfolded in all its awful and
stupendous reality: it is a passage to another state of being:
the disembodied soul flies and lives elsewhere: not, as on earth,
for a few short years, but for eternity.&nbsp; And what may be
thought or said of me, whether by the present or by future
generations, whether by friends or foes; what may become of my
property, baubles or possessions; what may be done with my
corpse, whether meanly or superbly coffined, whether laid without
winding-sheet or clothed with purple and fine linen,&mdash;all
these are matters of minor note, of comparative
indifference.&nbsp; I shall have been living and dying for
another, an eternal world; and the great consideration is, where
and what that world shall be.</p>
<p>We are thus led, as by the Apostle&rsquo;s own hand, to enter
more immediately on the text.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whether we live, we
live unto the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is the Lord, the Lord Jesus
Christ, who hath done these marvellous things for us; He has
removed from us the burden of the wrath of God; He has rescued us
from the bondage of corruption, and changed the curse into a
blessing; He has given unto us the Spirit of holiness, and thus
<a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>re-created
in our new-born soul the image of the righteous God.&nbsp; He
moreover has dispelled the clouds that rested on the tomb, and
has &ldquo;brought life and immortality to light by the
gospel.&rdquo;&nbsp; And O remember the mighty cost, the precious
sacrifice, by which He purchased us unto Himself.&nbsp; The
eternal Son of God stooped down from heaven to earth; the Word,
which was in the beginning with God and was God, was made flesh;
&ldquo;humbled Himself and became obedient unto death;&rdquo;
&ldquo;bore our sins in His own body on the tree:&rdquo; died and
rose again, rose as the first fruits of a sleeping world.&nbsp;
Thus have we &ldquo;passed from death to life,&rdquo; from nature
to grace, from ruin to a state of salvation.&nbsp; And no
believer can deny, that he is bound, &ldquo;whatsoever he does in
word or deed, to do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving
thanks to God and the Father by Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet, brethren, it is not merely what we are bound to do or to
be, as baptized into Christ and believing in His name; it is what
we <i>are</i>, actually <i>are</i>, as partakers of His gospel,
and cleansed by His blood.&nbsp; St. Paul says, &ldquo;we live
unto the Lord;&rdquo; we <i>do</i> so live as a matter of course
and necessity: our life is altogether devoted to Him: such is the
very meaning and essence of our Christian fellowship.&nbsp; Being
His real property, &ldquo;not our own, but bought with a
price,&rdquo; we place ourselves at His disposal: &ldquo;our meat
is to do the will of Him that sent us.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is our
decided character, by which we desire to be known; known of God
and known of all men.&nbsp; &ldquo;The life which we now live in
the flesh we live <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>by the faith of the Son of God, who loved us, and gave
Himself for us.&rdquo;&nbsp; It must unquestionably and
inevitably be so, for &ldquo;our life is hid with Christ in
God;&rdquo; this, if we are Christians, is the well-spring of our
thoughts and desires and feelings and principles and habits; and
though they contract a taste and taint of evil in their passage
through the corrupt channel of nature, still do they always
retain the proof and prevalence and ascendancy of their
heaven-born character; and do clearly mark us, in the eyes of
every spiritual and right-judging person, as members of Christ
and children of God.</p>
<p>Such are all the sincere followers of the Lamb, the faithful
and elect of God: all in their various spheres of life, high and
low, rich and poor; living in the same Spirit and by the same
gospel, unto the same redeeming Lord; and travelling together in
one way to the same everlasting kingdom.&nbsp; They are all
brethren; all of equal privileges in the sight of their God and
Saviour; all, however wide their worldly differences, however
diversified their appearances or acquirements, distinguished by
the same holy signs&mdash;by the sign of the cross in their
forehead; by the image of the cross in their heart; by the
bearing of the cross in their lives, and treading in the
footsteps of their divine Master.&nbsp; &ldquo;To me to live is
Christ:&rdquo; this is the common language, this the good
confession, this the joyful, thankful assurance of each and every
one: this their watchword, this their safeguard and defence, this
their abounding consolation, one with another, amid all the
dangers of an ensnaring <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>and harassing world.&nbsp; The rich
man has no other protection, and no other does the poor man need;
Christ is &ldquo;all in all,&rdquo; and &ldquo;none can pluck
them out of His hand;&rdquo; dwelling together, as in a strong
tower; &ldquo;kept by the power of God through faith unto
salvation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Each of them still, while in the body,
attentive to the duties of his own calling: no earthly business
or occupation, belonging to their respective conditions, despised
or neglected; but all &ldquo;done heartily as unto the Lord, and
not as unto men:&rdquo; all earthly desires so regulated, all
earthly plans so formed, all earthly objects so pursued, as not
to interrupt, much less to stifle, the life of God in the
soul.</p>
<p>Having lived unto the Lord, we shall die unto the Lord: having
continued His property through life, He will claim us as His own
in death.&nbsp; The tyrant of the grave shall have no power, no
dominion over us; his spear is broken; the battle fought, the
victory won: Christ has conquered, and we are &ldquo;more than
conquerors through Him that loved us.&rdquo;&nbsp; Christ is Lord
of the immortal spirit: &ldquo;He is able to keep that which is
committed to Him against that day;&rdquo; and when the soul
escapes from its prison-house, He sends a guardian angel to take
the charge, and conduct it safely to Abraham&rsquo;s bosom, to
the rest that remaineth for His people.&nbsp; Brethren, we have
the Lord&rsquo;s own word and authority, for the establishment of
our faith and the comforting of our souls.&nbsp; He said to the
penitent thief, &ldquo;To-day shalt thou be with me in
paradise.&rdquo;&nbsp; He admonished those who believed not, <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>that Jehovah
was declared to be &ldquo;the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac
and the God of Jacob&rdquo; long after their bodies were laid in
the grave: and &ldquo;God is not the God of the dead but of the
living, for all live unto Him.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this entire
confidence and security, His pious disciples in every age have
welcomed their latter end, and fallen asleep sweetly.&nbsp; The
first martyr Stephen, full of the Holy Ghost, worshipped and
prayed to Jesus in his dying moments, saying, &ldquo;Lord Jesus,
receive my spirit;&rdquo; at once a plain indisputable testimony,
that Christ is an object of divine worship, and that He does
receive the souls of the faithful, when delivered from their
earthly tabernacle.&nbsp; And the Apostle, who said, &ldquo;To me
to live is Christ,&rdquo; said also, in the same breath,
&ldquo;to die is gain:&rdquo; death could not be gain to him with
any thing less than Christ: it is evident, that St. Paul was rapt
in the contemplation of the immediate presence of his Lord:
whilst living, he was with Christ; when dead, he would be with
Him more blessedly still.</p>
<p>In truth, the proper representation of the matter is this;
&ldquo;the Lord&rsquo;s kingdom is an everlasting kingdom,&rdquo;
that which He has won by His victory over sin and death and the
grave, that which He has opened to all believers, that of which
every abiding believer is an actual and irremovable member.&nbsp;
It is a kingdom never ceasing or suspended; reaching onward
without a broken link, from time to eternity.&nbsp; The present
state of being should be regarded as the threshold of this
boundless kingdom; as but the foreground of <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>trial, in
which the Lord&rsquo;s servants are exercised and matured and
made meet for their full and final inheritance.&nbsp; Death is
called the gate of life, that life for which the present is but a
prelude and preparation.&nbsp; Earthly graces will be perfected
in heaven.&nbsp; The Lord&rsquo;s dominion over us is whole and
uninterrupted: He calls us from one division of His kingdom to
another, from one state to another, at His own time and in His
own way: &ldquo;He has the keys of death and hell,&rdquo; of
death and the unseen world.&nbsp; &ldquo;He openeth and no man
shutteth, and shutteth and no man openeth.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His
saints.&rdquo;&nbsp; He keeps them by His almighty power, keeps
them in His wisdom and mercy, till they are ripe for glory.&nbsp;
None can delay and none can hasten his work.&nbsp; And what
faithful soul would desire it?&nbsp; Nay, Lord, come and call
when Thou wilt; but make Thy servant ready.</p>
<p>O how refreshing, delightful, encouraging to us, on our way to
Zion, to perceive around us those who are &ldquo;living unto the
Lord,&rdquo; with their eyes and hearts fixed upon the heavenly
inheritance.&nbsp; And O still happier sight, and yet an awful
rejoicing, to behold a brother &ldquo;dying unto the Lord;&rdquo;
to witness the triumph of our holy faith, in nature&rsquo;s last
hour and Satan&rsquo;s last buffeting; to observe the trophies of
divine love adorning and cheering the melancholy bed&mdash;the
tranquil smile, the unwearied trust, the patient contented
thankful resignation; the uplifted hand and eye, the illuminated
countenance, the peaceful spirit all the <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>while ready
to wing its flight.&nbsp; Go boastful science, go vain
philosophy, and visit the death-beds of your votaries; mark well
the doubts and fears betraying themselves under the mask of a
bold profession; mark the impatience and vexation; the present
burden and the miserable foreboding; go and discover your infidel
champions, the proud Goliaths of your kingdom, trembling and
quailing under the lifted stroke of death; and despairing under
the load of unforgiven sin, under the terrors of an insulted and
avenging God.&nbsp; Go to your despisers of the crucified Jesus,
to those who have been too wise to seek or too busy to find Him;
see them, as I have seen, stretching out their hands in agony,
and saying, &ldquo;Is there none to save a fellow-creature from
destruction?&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, when ye are sickened with such
scenes, repair to the bedside of a departing saint, and see how a
Christian can die.&nbsp; Go and study a lesson, more instructive
and more precious than all your pages of human lore and learning;
go and learn from a lovely example, how to live and how to
die.</p>
<p>If I seem to be describing these blessed truths and facts with
a minuteness and a particularity and a real resemblance, it is
because I am drawing from the life; because they have been so
recently embodied before my eyes in the person of a Christian
friend and minister&mdash;your deceased pastor.&nbsp; You know
that he lived unto the Lord: and I have enjoyed the privilege of
attesting the fruit of that living in his latter days&mdash;days
of severe pain, but days of comfort and serenity.&nbsp; He spoke
<a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>thereof in
a manner, which convinced me, that he wished his views and
experience to be made public; possibly looking forward to the
day, when I might be fulfilling this very office.&nbsp; He said
&ldquo;I wish you distinctly to understand how I am: I have no
ecstasies, no rapturous flights, but a calm composure, a quiet
resting, a peaceful waiting for the Lord: and I desire the Lord
to deal with me as seemeth to Him good: to give me patience, to
give me his grace that I may endure unto the end; and to continue
or remove me at His pleasure.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was an affecting
communication, an overcoming moment.</p>
<p>By these and similar words, it was manifest that he set his
great value, not upon any peculiar notions or points of doctrine,
but upon a living and fruitful faith, upon the practical
influence of the spirit of God; upon the state of mind and heart
and character and life, as resulting from christian principles
and views.</p>
<p>Such undoubtedly then has been the scope, such the
transcendent object of his ministerial endeavours and
exertions&mdash;to produce like faith and fruit in you: and you,
brethren, will bear a willing testimony to his holy zeal and
faithfulness; through a period of well nigh thirty years have you
made trial of him, yea full proof of his labour of love.&nbsp;
The memory of him is bound round your hearts by a multitude of
the tenderest holiest ties.&nbsp; Many of you he baptized into
the church of Christ; he has been all along your spiritual guide,
training you up from childhood in the way you should go.&nbsp; To
many has he delivered the blessed elements, the signs of the body
and blood of Christ, as ye were assembled around <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>him at the
table of your Lord, and feasted together upon redeeming
love.&nbsp; Many has he visited on beds of sickness, relieving
your wants and comforting your sorrows, and teaching you to
improve them all.&nbsp; And not a few of your relatives and
friends, gone to rest, he attended in their last moments; and
instructed and confirmed and soothed their lingering
spirit.&nbsp; You remember the scene: you saw and loved him
there: and you owe him now a debt of gratitude.&nbsp; And in many
a walk of kindness and usefulness, and many a place of righteous
resort, you have watched and honoured and applauded him: but his
race is run; he is gone; and the place that knew him, shall know
him no more.</p>
<p>Nor were his services confined within the precincts of his own
congregation, but always ready to be extended far and near.&nbsp;
Various societies and charities have rejoiced in his help and
activity, and will heavily feel their loss.&nbsp; But I must
forbear and leave the fond strain of regret, for a word of
serious and spiritual improvement.&nbsp; Was he faithful?&nbsp;
Then the larger account have you to render.&nbsp; Did he preach
the truth in love?&nbsp; Then the more will his preaching condemn
those hearers, who have failed to be convinced and
converted.&nbsp; He has expounded and illustrated for you the
whole of the sacred volume, from Genesis to Revelation; he dug
deeply into that precious mine in the field of the word of God,
and presented for your acceptance the treasures and the jewels in
all their intrinsic worth and brightness.&nbsp; The Bible, the
inexhaustible <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>stores of the whole Bible, he laid open before you in
all their vast and magnificent abundance; and led you, by precept
and by example, to &ldquo;the way and the truth and the
life.&rdquo;&nbsp; If you have not received the word and the
spirit of grace, if you have not laid the doctrine to your soul,
if you have not in earnest begun the goodly work, if you are not
far advanced, the fault is not with the departed: you will not
seek to charge him with neglect.&nbsp; Whom then? and where does
the burden lie?&nbsp; &ldquo;Son of man, speak to the children of
thy people and say unto them, when I bring the sword upon a land,
if the people of the land take a man of their coasts, and set him
for their watchman: If when he seeth the sword come upon the
land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people: Then whosoever
heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning; if the
sword come and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own
head.&rdquo;&nbsp; The trumpet has sounded in your ears, long and
loud; the clear, thrilling, evangelical trumpet.&nbsp; The herald
of God has done his duty; would to God that every conscience
could whisper, &ldquo;And I have done mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And all you, who have listened to him with teachableness and
sincerity, who have caught from his lips the word of life into
your willing ear, and laid it up in your heart, take comfort and
be thankful.&nbsp; You have not profited as you might, as you
would now fain have done: you lament your infirmities and
corruptions; your minister lamented his: but the Lord loveth
sincerity, and pardoneth the transgressions of His people.&nbsp;
<a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>You value
your past privileges; and you adore that divine goodness, which
made them profitable to your salvation.&nbsp; You dwell, not with
the tear of sharp regret for a ministry slighted, for
opportunities unregarded and lost; but with tears of grateful
love, in the remembrance of one, who was ordained by God to
lighten your darkness, and to be the messenger of peace to your
soul.&nbsp; And while you are gathering here the plentiful fruits
of righteousness, you are looking forward to the far more
glorious harvest in the end of the world; looking to the day,
when the shepherd and his flock shall stand together for
presentation before the eternal throne; and he shall say,
&ldquo;Lord here am I, and those whom thou hast given
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>O my brethren, no sheep of his, no true member of the
Lord&rsquo;s flock, shall be forgotten on that day.&nbsp; The
world knows them not; the earthly shepherd himself may not have
known them all: but &ldquo;the Lord knoweth them that are
His.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rich or poor, honoured or despised, loved or
hated among men, if they have lived unto the Lord and died unto
the Lord, the Lord will confess them at last, will infallibly
select them every one out of an assembled world, and set them on
His right hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Them which sleep in Jesus will God
bring with Him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Be this my sleep, come soon, come

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
